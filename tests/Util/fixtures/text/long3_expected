How long to wait for confirmation of unicast frames (**ACKs**)
before considering transmission unsuccessful, or in short **ACK-Timeout**.
Distance value has these behaviors:
- *Dynamic* - causes AP to detect and use the smallest timeout that works with all connected clients.
- *Indoor* - uses the default ACK timeout value that the hardware chip manufacturer has set.
- *Number* - uses the input value in formula: ACK-timeout = ((**distance** \* 1000) + 299) / 300 us
