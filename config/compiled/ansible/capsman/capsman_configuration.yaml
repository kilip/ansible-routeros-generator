            Access Point advertises one of these ciphers, multiple values can be selected. Access Point uses it to encrypt all broadcast and multicast

            Protocol - encryption protocol, compatible with legacy WEP equipment, but enhanced to correct some of the WEP flaws.
            - aes-ccm - more secure WPA encryption protocol, based on the reliable AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Networks free of WEP legacy
            should use only this cipher.

            This property has effect only when **security.eap-methods** contains *eap-tls*. - verify-certificate - Require remote device to have valid
            certificate. Check that it is signed by known certificate authority. No additional identity verification is done. Certificate may include
            information about time period during which it is valid. If router has incorrect time and date, it may reject valid certificate because
            router's clock is outside that period. See also the L(Certificates, https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:System/Certificates)

            - dont-verify-certificate - Do not check certificate of the remote device. Access Point will not require client to provide certificate.
            - no-certificates - Do not use certificates. TLS session is established using 2048 bit anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
            - verify-certificate-with-crl - Same as verify-certificate but also checks if the certificate is valid by checking the Certificate
