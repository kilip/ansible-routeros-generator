Can be used to filter all broadcast traffic on an egress port. Broadcast traffic is considered as traffic that uses **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF** as destination MAC address, such traffic is crucial for many protocols such as DHCP, ARP, NDP, BOOTP (Netinstall) and others.

            Set port as edge port or non-edge port, or enable edge discovery. Edge ports are connected to a LAN that has no other bridges attached. An edge port will skip the learning and the listening states in STP and will transition directly to the forwarding state, this reduces the STP initialization time. If the port is configured to discover edge port then as soon as the bridge detects a BPDU coming to an edge port, the port becomes a non-edge port. This property has no effect when <var>protocol-mode</var> is set to `none`.
            
            - `no` - non-edge port, will participate in learning and listening states in STP.
            - `no-discover` - non-edge port with enabled discovery, will participate in learning and listening states in STP, a port can become edge port if no BPDU is received.
            - `yes` - edge port without discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state.
            - `yes-discover` - edge port with enabled discovery, will transit directly to forwarding state.
            - `auto` - same as `no-discover`, but will additionally detect if bridge port is a Wireless interface with disabled bridge-mode, such interface will be automatically set as an edge port without discovery.

          default: temporary-query
          description: |
            Changes the state of a bridge port whether IGMP membership reports are going to be forwarded to this port. By default IGMP membership reports (most importantly IGMP Join messages) are only forwarded to ports that have a multicast router or a IGMP Snooping enabled bridge connected to. Without at least one port marked as a `multicast-router` IPTV might not work properly, it can be either detected automatically or forced manually.
            
            - `disabled` - IGMP membership reports are not forwarded through this port regardless what is connected to it.
            - `permanent` - IGMP membership reports are forwarded through this port regardless what is connected to it.
            - `temporary-query` - automatically detect multicast routers and IGMP Snooping enabled bridges.
            
            You can improve security by forcing ports that have IPTV boxes connected to never become ports marked as `multicast-router`. This property only has effect when <var>igmp-snooping</var> is set to `yes`.

          type: str
          choices: [auto, 'no', 'yes']
          default: auto
          description: 'Specifies if a bridge port is connected to a bridge using a point-to-point link for faster convergence in case of failure. By setting this property to `yes`, you are forcing the link to be a point-to-point link, which will skip the checking mechanism, which detects and waits BPDUs from other devices from this single link, by setting this property to `no`, you are expecting that a link can receive BPDUs from multiple devices. By setting the property to `yes`, you are significantly improving (R/M)STP convergence time. In general, you should only set this property to `no` if it is possible that another device can be connected between a link, this is mostly relevant to Wireless mediums and Ethernet hubs. If the Ethernet link is full-duplex, `auto` enables point-to-point functionality. And this property has no effect when <var>protocol-mode</var> is set to `none`.'
        priority:

Multicast addresses that are in `/interface bridge mdb` are considered as learned multicasts and therefore will not be flooded to all ports. Without IGMP Snooping all multicast traffic will be dropped on egress ports. Has effect only on an egress port. This option does not limit traffic flood to the CPU. Note that local multicast addresses (224.0.0.0/24) are not flooded when <var>unknown-multicast-flood</var> is disabled, as a result some protocols that rely on local multicast addresses might not work properly, such protocols are RIPv2m OSPF, mDNS, VRRP and others. Some protocols do send a IGMP join request and therefore are compatible with IGMP Snooping, some OSPF implementations are compatible with RFC1584, RouterOS OSPF implementation is not compatible with IGMP Snooping. This property should only be used when <var>igmp-snooping</var> is set to `yes`.'
        unknown_unicast_flood:
          type: bool
          default: 'True'
          description: 'When enabled, bridge floods unknown unicast traffic to all bridge egress ports. When disabled, drops unknown unicast traffic on egress ports. If a MAC address is not learned in `/interface bridge host`, then the traffic is considered as unknown unicast traffic and will be flooded to all ports. MAC address is learnt as soon as a packet on a bridge port is received, then the source MAC address is added to the bridge host table. Since it is required for the bridge to receive at least one packet on the bridge port to learn the MAC address, it is recommended to use static bridge host entries to avoid packets being dropped until the MAC address has been learnt. Has effect only on an egress port. This option does not limit traffic flood to the CPU.'
