      - <var>proxy-arp</var> - the router performs proxy ARP on the interface and sends replies to other interfaces
      - <var>reply-only</var> - the interface will only reply to requests originated from matching IP address/MAC address combinations which are entered as static entries in the [ ARP](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/ARP "Manual:IP/ARP") table. No dynamic entries will be automatically stored in the ARP table. Therefore for communications to be successful, a valid static entry must already exist.

      - **Note1:** Auto-negotiation should not be disabled on one end only, otherwise Ethernet Interfaces may not work properly.
