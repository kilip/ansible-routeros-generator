      This property has effect only in AP mode. Setting it to *yes* can remove this network from the list of wireless networks that are shown by some client software. Changing this setting does not improve the security of the wireless network, because SSID is included in other frames sent by the AP.

      Access Point advertises one of these ciphers, multiple values can be selected. Access Point uses it to encrypt all broadcast and multicast frames. Client attempts connection only to Access Points that use one of the specified group ciphers.
      
      - <var>tkip</var> - Temporal Key Integrity Protocol - encryption protocol, compatible with legacy WEP equipment, but enhanced to correct some of the WEP flaws.
      - <var>aes-ccm</var> - more secure WPA encryption protocol, based on the reliable AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Networks free of WEP legacy should use only this cipher.

      - <var>verify-certificate</var> - Require remote device to have valid certificate. Check that it is signed by known certificate authority. No additional identity verification is done. Certificate may include information about time period during which it is valid. If router has incorrect time and date, it may reject valid certificate because router's clock is outside that period. See also the [ Certificates](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:System/Certificates "Manual:System/Certificates") configuration.
      - <var>dont-verify-certificate</var> - Do not check certificate of the remote device. Access Point will not require client to provide certificate.
      - <var>no-certificates</var> - Do not use certificates. TLS session is established using 2048 bit anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
      - <var>verify-certificate-with-crl</var> - Same as verify-certificate but also checks if the certificate is valid by checking the Certificate Revocation List.
