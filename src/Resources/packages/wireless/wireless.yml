    short_description: Wireless Access List Configuration
    description: |
      Access list is used by access point to restrict allowed connections from other devices, and to control connection parameters.
      Operation:
        - Access list rules are checked sequentially.
        - Disabled rules are always ignored.
        - Only the first matching rule is applied.
        - If there are no matching rules for the remote connection, then the default values from the wireless interface configuration are used.
        - If remote device is matched by rule that has authentication=no value, the connection from that remote device is rejected.

  documentation:
    short_description: Wireless Connect List Configuration
    description: |
      - connect-list is used to assign priority and security settings to connections with remote access points, and to restrict allowed connections. connect-list is an ordered list of rules. Each rule in connect-list is attached to specific wireless interface, specified in the interface property of that rule (this is unlike access-list, where rules can apply to all interfaces). Rule can match MAC address of remote access point, it's signal strength and many other parameters.
      Operation:
      - connect-list rules are always checked sequentially, starting from the first.
      - disabled rules are always ignored.
      - Only the first matching rule is applied.
      - If SSID or exact wireless protocol is provided in the wireless interface configuration Connect List SSIDs or wireless protocols not covered by wireless interface configuration are ignored.
      - If connect-list does not have any rule that matches remote access point, then the default values from the wireless interface configuration are used.
      - If access point is matched by rule that has connect=no value, connection with this access point will not be attempted.
      - If access point is matched by rule that has connect=yes value, connection with this access point will be attempted.
        - In station mode, if several remote access points are matched by connect list rules with connect=yes value, connection will be attempted with access point that is matched by rule higher in the connect-list.
        - If no remote access points are matched by connect-list rules with connect=yes value, then value of default-authentication interface property determines whether station will attempt to connect to any access point. If default-authentication=yes, station will choose access point with best signal and compatible security.
      - In access point mode, connect-list is checked before establishing WDS link with remote device. If access point is not matched by any rule in the connect list, then the value of default-authentication determines whether WDS link will be established.
