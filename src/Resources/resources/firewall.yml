  html_id: Properties
  description: The firewall implements packet filtering and thereby provides security functions that are used to manage data flow to, from and through the router. Along with the Network Address Translation it serves as a tool for preventing unauthorized access to directly attached networks and the router itself as well as a filter for outgoing traffic.

firewall_nat:
  url: https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/Firewall/NAT
  html_id: Properties
  description: Network Address Translation is an Internet standard that allows hosts on local area networks to use one set of IP addresses for internal communications and another set of IP addresses for external communications. A LAN that uses NAT is referred as natted network. For NAT to function, there should be a NAT gateway in each natted network. The NAT gateway (NAT router) performs IP address rewriting on the way a packet travel from/to LAN.

  html_id: Properties
  description: Firewall RAW table allows to selectively bypass or drop packets before connection tracking that way significantly reducing load on CPU. Tool is very useful for DOS attack mitigation.
    RAW table does not have matchers that depend on connection tracking ( like connection-state, layer7 etc.).
    If packet is marked to bypass connection tracking packet de-fragmentation will not occur.
